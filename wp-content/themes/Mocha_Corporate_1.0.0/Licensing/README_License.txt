2.You are licensed to use the Item to create as many End Products (i.e. customised implementations of the Item) as you wish for yourself or for clients.
3.An End Product is a customised implementation of the Item. Example : a website customized with your content.
For example: the Item is the child-theme and the end product is the final website customised with your content.


Things you are allowed to do with the Item

4.You can create one or several End Product(s) for a client, and you can transfer that/those End Product(s) to your client for any fee.
5.You can modify or manipulate the Item. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product(s) you then create is/are allowed under clause 3.

Things you are not allowed to do with the item

6.You or an end user of your End Product can’t re-distribute the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You or an end user of your End Product can’t do this with an Item either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you or an end user of your End Product modify the Item. You or an end user of your End Product can’t re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with modifications. These things are not allowed.


For example: You can’t sell the Item as is or with modifications nor can you distribute it for free. You can’t license the Item and then make it available as-is on your website for your users to download.
